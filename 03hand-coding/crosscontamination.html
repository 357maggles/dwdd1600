    <h2>Cross Contamination</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Cross Contamination page of Wheatless Warfare! Cross contamination occurs when gluten-containing foods 
        come into contact with gluten-free items, potentially leading to harmful exposure for those with celiac disease or gluten 
        intolerance. Even trace amounts of gluten can trigger serious reactions, making it crucial to understand how this can 
        happen in your kitchen, at restaurants, or anywhere food is prepared. Here, you'll find detailed insights into common 
        sources of cross contamination and practical strategies to prevent it. By staying informed and vigilant, you can protect 
        your health and enjoy safe, delicious meals. Let's ensure your gluten-free journey remains worry-free!

    <h2>What is Cross Contamination?</h2>
    <p>
        I found that one of the hardest parts about becoming completely gluten-free was navigating the world of cross contamination.
        What even is it? How was I supposed to avoid it? And most of all, I clean my stuff all the time!! How was I still getting 
        contaminated?! After visiting a dietition who gave me a lot of advice (highly recommend) and resources I was able to define
        some key elements of cross contamination.

        <dt><strong>Cross Contamination</strong></dt>
        <dd> <em>Cross-contact</em> (also known as cross contamination) is a process by which a gluten-free product comes into contact with 
            something that is not gluten-free. <em>Cross-contact</em> of gluten-free food with gluten-containing food can occur at any time. 
            This includes from the field, to the processing plant, to the store or restaurant, and to your kitchen. It can occur 
            anywhere food is stored, prepared, and served. <a href="https://www.bidmc.org/centers-and-departments/digestive-disease-center/services-and-programs/celiac-center/celiacnow/nutrition-and-the-gluten-free-diet/cross-contamination">[source1]</a>

        <dt><strong>"May Contain" on Food Labels</strong></dt>
        <dd><em>May Contain</em> means some manufacturers voluntarily include a separate advisory statement, such as <em>may contain</em>  
            or <em>produced in a facility</em>, on their labels when there is a chance that a food allergen could be present. A manufacturer
             might use the same equipment to make different products. Even after cleaning this equipment, a small amount of an allergen 
             (such as peanuts) that was used to make one product (such as cookies) may become part of another product (such as 
             crackers). In this case, the cracker label might state “may contain peanuts.” <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/have-food-allergies-read-label#:~:text=Some%20manufacturers%20voluntarily%20include%20a,equipment%20to%20make%20different%20products.">[source2]</a>
            </dd>
        <dt><strong>Restaurant Requirements</strong></dt>
        <dd>Don't be afraid to demand safety! Restaurants are required to adapt to your needs if they provide gluten-free options 
            by the FDA. FDA recognizes that compliance with the gluten-free regulation in processed foods and food served in
            restaurants is important for the health of people with celiac disease. FDA’s regulation established a federal definition of the
            term “gluten-free” for food manufacturers that voluntarily label FDA-regulated foods as “gluten-free.” The definition
            was intended to provide a reliable way for people with celiac disease to avoid gluten, and, given the public health
            significance of gluten, restaurants’ use of gluten-free labeling should be consistent with the federal definition.
            <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/91945/download#:~:text=The%20rule%20specifies%2C%20among%20other,using%20scientifically%20validated%20analytical%20methods.">[source3]</a>
