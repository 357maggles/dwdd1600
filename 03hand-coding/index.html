    <h2>Who is Wheatless Warfare?</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Maggie, a diagnosed celiac with severe symptoms trying to navigate life in the Gluten-Free world. While navigating
        my life, I've realized that there aren't a whole lot of easy, simple, and resourceful places to learn how to be safely
        Gluten-Free. Don't get me wrong, there's tons of cool websites with food recommendations, but none really help with the lifestyle
        change. That's what this site is for! Here I'll try to simplify dealing with:
        <ul>
            <li>Cross Contamination</li>
            <li>Eating Out</li>
            <li>How to Cook Safely</li>
            <li>How to Cook on a Budget</li>
            <li>Where to Shop with Actual Good Products</li>
            <li>Being a Proud Confident Gluten-Free Person</li>
    
        </ul>
        I'm excited to share my knowledge with all of you and hope that it all helps with your journey however far along you are
        on it!
